    <h1> The Dog </h1>
    <img src="omg.png">
      <p> Canis lupis familiaris, or dogs, are members of the genus Canis, or canines, that form a part of the group wolf-like canids. They have been domesticated for many years and now coexist as man (and woman)'s best friend, and for good reason. For hundreds of years, domesticated dogs have been used for hunting, protection, and company. All dogs, from the large Mastiff, to small Tea Cup Chihuahua, all share in the benefit of a well-established relationship wtih humans.  </p>
    <h1> Types of Dogs </h1>
      <p> According to the World Canine Organization (FCI), there are 339 registered breeds of dogs. Some of the most popular breeds of dogs according to the American Kennel Club are listed below.</p>

    <h1> The Benefits of Dogs</h1>
      <p> As demonstrated in the table of data below, dogs offer both physical and emotional health benefits to not only the owner, but aslo all those who interact with them, discounting those who suffer from allergies. I collected this data through making up statistics to create this table for Mr McGeehan. But also who doesn't love dogs?
      People from ages 0-50 were surveyed and asked if they liked dogs, and the table represents the percentage of people who responded yes.</p></divclass>
